In late September we booked a couple of cheap flights from Bristol to Lisboa for a long weekend. 

We arrived around 8pm on a Thursday evening, grabbed a taxi to our air bnb apartment, which only took about 20 mins. 

Our
apartment was in the hustle and bustle of it all, Biarro Alto. Renowned
for its buzy nightlife, narrow cobbled streets and cosy restaurants. We
were very lucky to be able to nip across the road from our apartment 
into little restaurant opposite, which was charming and friendly, a real
local restaurant. The restaurant is called : Cantino do bem Esatar

A little view from apartment  

After that we went on for a couple of cocktails to end the evening. Biarro Alto is the heart of the nightlife in Lisbon. 

Over
the next couple of days we walked extensivly, exploring all the 
beautiful architecture and stopping off at a couple of kiosks which 
served a little pastry with a glass of port or red wine for less than €4
- it became our little treat after a days exploration.

Beautiful streets everywhere you turn  

You
can't go wrong in Lisbon - everywhere you turn you will find either a 
cafe, interesting shops, galleries and or buzzing restaurants/bars. Make
sure you take some comfortable shoes!  

Steep streets!  

If
you want to rest your feet pop on one of the trams, we took N28 which 
went from Biarro Alto to the Alfama, which again is a lovely area in 
Lisbon full of history and monasteries.  

We also took the city 
sight seeing bus, which we normally don't do. But it was great and way 
of seeing the whole of Lisbon and you could hop on and off. In the 
result of this we found this little gem of a restaurant called 
Restaurante Flor Santo Antonio [https://www.zomato.com/pt/grande-lisboa/flor-de-santo-antónio-lapa-estrela-lisboa ][0]-
a must go. This place is a local canteen, serving small menu of well 
prepared local dishes. We shared a caraf of red wine and had salted fish
(Bacalhau) to share while sitting back watching the locals come and go.

Simplicity is the best!  

In the evening we ventured to the top of a car park and found a very 
cool roof top bar called 'Park Bar ' with the most amazing views across 
the city- best place to watch the sunset! [http://www.welovelisbon.net/food-and-drink/park][0]

Arrive early evening to get a good spot!

Nightlife in Lisbon  

You can find a lot of roof top bars for the summer evenings, most of 
the hotels have one. Most receptions ask if you have a reservation, but 
they usually let us through if you say you would just like a couple of 
drinks. 

If you are in Lisbon for a long weekend and you would 
like to get out of the city, take the train to a beach about 15 mins out
of town. Most of the residents of Lisbon do head for the beach at the 
weekends, so try avoid the main station and get on at one of the smaller
ones further down the line (Santos)- this way you won't have any queues
and and we stopped off at a random station which mentioned it had a 
beach- was perfect!! Make sure you take a little snack and drink with 
you.

Beach just outside Lisbon  

I would throughly recommend for anyone to visit Lisbon! It is a 
fantastic place for a city break, everyone is friendly and the city is 
vibrant with lots to see and experience!  Oh and don't forget the 
custard tarts (Pasteis de Nata). Best eaten eaten warm from the oven in 
one of the many cafes, with a nice strong expresso.
